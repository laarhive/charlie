Instruction to paste at the start of the next chat:



When you provide documentation in Markdown format meant to be copied into a repository:
* Always wrap the entire document in an outer quadruple-backtick Markdown block (````markdown … ````).
* Inside that document, use normal triple backticks for code blocks.
* Do not indent fences.
* Do not mix Markdown with HTML.
* Output must be copy-paste safe and render correctly on GitHub without edits.

Always wrap repo documentation in an outer quadruple-backtick Markdown block so it is copy-paste safe
