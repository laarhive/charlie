# Project CHARLIE

## What Charlie does

Charlie is an autonomous interactive mascot that senses people in the real world and orchestrates AI-powered voice conversations in response.

It can:
- Detect people approaching in **front** and leaving from **behind**
- Decide **when to start or stop a conversation**
- Trigger **ChatGPT Voice** on a phone
- React to **physical interaction**
- Log events for debugging and analytics
